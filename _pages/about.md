Hello world!

I am currently a PostDoc in the Institute for Computational Genomics at the RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Germany.
Working mainly with large genomics and epigenomics datasets, I build machine learning models to find interesting biomarkers, I build bioinformatics pipelines to facilitate analysis, and I build new bioinformatics/comp bio methods to solve niche problems. In sum, I like using big data to help find nuance in complex patterns and just generally like building things :)
